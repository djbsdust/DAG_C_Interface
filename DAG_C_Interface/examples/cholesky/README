The example is in a mess
some of the functions are extracted out of blas library, while one of them still call BLAS directly.
Is there a resonable explanation? 
Perhaps we should fix it.


this example now need BLAS library
But I am not sure if we really need the following path designation? please make sure... 
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/OpenBLAS/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH


how make?
  make dag
  make omp

How run
  ./a.out nblocks dimext num_threads
